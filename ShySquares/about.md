This is just a simple webtoy, showing a simple mouse interaction

move the mouse around to push the squares, squares snap back into place

To do list:
- create square object
- create mouse/square interaction
- tile square object

idea board:
I think I need to create a square object that has a base and a radius and a sprite that moves
the sprite moves around in a circle of size radius while the base stays still, that way the sprite can move back once the mouse is out of the radius
